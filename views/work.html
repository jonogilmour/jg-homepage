		<p>This page lists my current and past works sorted into two categories</p>
		<p>Major projects are those I consider a personal achievement; something I'm proud of. Usually these projects took several weeks or months to complete and required learning new skills from scratch.</p>
		<p>Minor projects are usually smaller exercises that I worked on to accomplish a smaller task, such as demonstrating use of a few algorithms, and took 1-2 weeks to complete.</p>

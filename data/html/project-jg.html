<p>This website you're currently using was a personal learning exercise that turned into something a lot bigger.</p>
<p>I initially started this site as a way to learn NodeJS and try my hand at creating a webserver from the ground up. Then, I decided I would build a website from the ground up on this platform to really showcase my skills at web development, like an online resum√©.</p>
<p>Prior to creating this site, I only had experience in Javascript and JQuery - zero NodeJS, zero AngularJS, and not much BDD experience either. In creating this site I set out to accomplish a few goals</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn a backend framework (Node)</li>
<li>Learn a frontend framework (Angular)</li>
<li>Learn a testing framework and learn BDD/TDD (Mocha)</li>
<li>Become more proficient at the Git command line</li>
<li>Learn more about web design and responsive design, using tools like Bootstrap and SASS</li>
</ul>
<p>In just over a week I was building templates and partials with helpers using Handlebars, adding dynamic routes in Express, and loading data from JSON files to populate web content without writing a single extra line of HTML (this projects section is built from JSON), and a whole lot more.</p>
<p>What you see here is built completely from the ground up from scratch. I've used Heroku simply to host the site publicly, and I've written every line of code and every HTML template myself. Mobile has been at the forefront of my mind during development, so every change is tested on large devices, like laptops and desktops, and mobile devices, like iPad and iPhone, to ensure that everything is just as usable and presentable on mobile as it is on larger screens. In doing so I've learned an incredible amount about responsive design, and rather than creating separate mobile/desktop sites, the one site simply fits different formats.</p>
<p>I've also made sure to minimise dependency on client-side Javascript, and do as much templating, routing, and data processing as possible on the server-side. Turning off Javascript will not affect the function of the site, simply disabling "nice-to-haves" rather than "must-haves". All custom CSS is compiled using SASS on the server, utilising mixins, nested selectors, variables, and @media queries, amongst others.</p>
<p>During the course of this (ongoing) project, I've fallen further in love with web development, and now enjoy coding the backend just as much as designing the frontend, and the skills I've acquired can be applied to a wealth of other scenarios outside of web development as well.</p>
